Getting Started:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd /your_project_directory [This is change directory]
git checkout name_of_branch [This switches you to the branch you'd like to work on, this should change your Android Studio branch as well]

Ensuring Your Branch is Current: (Try doing this before pushing your changes out)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch [fetches all changes in your current branch]
git pull [adds all the fetched changes to your current branch]

Adding Changes to Branch:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git commit -m 'what you did (your name)' [Be detailed and concise, and give yourself credit so we know]
git add . [. is a wild card to add all committed changes but you can hand pick individual commits if you'd like]
git push [This will add all your commits and local changes to your remote branch]

Other Things to Know:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git diff [shows you all changes from last committed changes and what you currently have]
git status [shows you untracked, staged files, and unstaged files, basically shows you everything and its current state]
-f [This is a force flag, be careful this is FORCEFUL]
